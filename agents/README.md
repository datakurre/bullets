# Agent Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for LLM agents working on the bullets project.

## Purpose

The `./agents/` directory provides modular, focused documentation that supplements the main [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) file. While AGENTS.md provides a high-level overview and quick reference, documents in this directory contain detailed architectural decisions, implementation guides, and specialized topics.

## Directory Structure

- `adr/` - Architecture Decision Records documenting key design choices
- Additional focused documentation files (to be added as needed)

## How to Use

When working on the bullets project:
1. Start with [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for project overview and current status
2. Refer to specific documents in `./agents/` for detailed information
3. Check `adr/` for architectural decisions and rationale

## Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documents focused on a single topic or component
- Use cross-references to link related documentation
- Update this README when adding new documentation files
- Maintain consistency with main AGENTS.md
